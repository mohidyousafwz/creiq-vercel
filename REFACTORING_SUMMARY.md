# CREIQ Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The CREIQ codebase has been refactored to improve organization, maintainability, and prepare for future features like a dashboard, database integration, and Docker deployment.

## Major Changes

### 1. **Improved Folder Structure**
```
src/creiq/
├── config/           # Centralized configuration
├── models/           # Data models for future DB
├── services/         # Business logic layer
├── utils/            # Utility functions
├── api.py           # RESTful API
└── playwright_automation.py  # Core scraping logic
```

### 2. **Configuration Management**
- Created `config/settings.py` for centralized configuration
- All settings now loaded from environment variables
- Proper validation and defaults

### 3. **Service Layer**
- Created `ExtractionService` to handle business logic
- Cleaner separation between API and extraction logic
- Better testability

### 4. **Improved Testing**
- Removed outdated tests
- Created proper unit tests for extraction
- Test coverage for service layer
- Test runner script in `scripts/`

### 5. **Better Code Organization**
- Moved utilities to `utils/` folder
- Created models for future database integration
- Proper Python package structure with `__init__.py` files

### 6. **Updated Dependencies**
- Organized requirements.txt with sections
- Removed unused dependencies
- Added development tools

### 7. **Scripts Folder**
- `test_extraction.py` - Test single roll number extraction
- `run_tests.py` - Run test suite with coverage

### 8. **API Improvements**
- Background task tracking
- Task status endpoints
- Better error handling
- CORS support

### 9. **Logging**
- Centralized logger configuration
- Consistent logging across modules
- Configurable log levels

### 10. **Cleanup**
- Removed duplicate test files
- Removed outdated documentation
- Updated .gitignore
- Cleaned up unnecessary files

## Ready for Next Features

The codebase is now ready for:

1. **Dashboard Implementation**
   - Static files structure in place
   - API endpoints ready
   - Authentication configuration prepared

2. **Database Integration**
   - Models structure created
   - SQLAlchemy ready to be enabled
   - Migration support prepared

3. **Docker Deployment**
   - docker-compose.yml already present
   - Clean dependency management
   - Environment-based configuration

4. **Scheduled Jobs**
   - Service layer ready for cron integration
   - Background task infrastructure in place

5. **Advanced Features**
   - Export to multiple formats
   - Email notifications
   - Rate limiting
   - Advanced search/filtering

## Testing the Refactored Code

1. **Test extraction**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/test_extraction.py
   ```

2. **Run API**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/run_tests.py
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Implement authentication system
2. Create web dashboard
3. Add database models
4. Set up Docker deployment
5. Add scheduled extraction capabilities
